  abstract = {Moore's law has so far relied on the aggressive scaling of CMOS silicon minimum features of over 1000{\texttimes} for over four decades, and recently, on the adoption of innovative features, such as Cu interconnects, low-k dielectrics for interconnects, strained channels, and high-k materials for gate dielectrics, resulting in a better power performance, cost per function, and density every generation. This has spawned a vibrant system-on-chip (SoC) approach, where progressively more function has been integrated on a single die. The integration of multiple dies on packages and boards has, however, scaled only modestly by a factor of three to five times. In this paper, we show that with the apparent slowing down of semiconductor scaling and the advent of the Internet of Things, there is a focus on heterogeneous integration and system-level scaling. Packaging is undergoing a transformation that focuses on overall system performance and cost rather than on individual components. We propose ways in which this transformation can evolve to provide a significant value at the system level while providing a significantly lower barrier to entry compared with a chip-based SoC approach that is currently used. This transformation is already under way with 3-D stacking of dies and will evolve to make heterogeneous integration the backbone of sustaining Moore's law in the years ahead.},

@article{novickHighbandwidthDensitySilicon2023,
  abstract  = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today's---and tomorrow's---data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach--Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},

  abstract  = {Silicon photonics has developed into a mainstream technology driven by advances in optical communications. The current generation has led to a proliferation of integrated photonic devices from thousands to millions-mainly in the form of communication transceivers for data centers. Products in many exciting applications, such as sensing and computing, are around the corner. What will it take to increase the proliferation of silicon photonics from millions to billions of units shipped? What will the next generation of silicon photonics look like? What are the common threads in the integration and fabrication bottlenecks that silicon photonic applications face, and which emerging technologies can solve them? This perspective article is an attempt to answer such questions. We chart the generational trends in silicon photonics technology, drawing parallels from the generational definitions of CMOS technology. We identify the crucial challenges that must be solved to make giant strides in CMOS-foundry-compatible devices, circuits, integration, and packaging. We identify challenges critical to the next generation of systems and applications---in communication, signal processing, and sensing. By identifying and summarizing such challenges and opportunities, we aim to stimulate further research on devices, circuits, and systems for the silicon photonics ecosystem.},

@article{wuFlexibleSiliconPhotonic2024,
  abstract  = {The increasing size and complexity of deep learning (DL) models have led to the wide adoption of distributed training methods in datacenters (DCs) and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. However, communication among distributed computing units (CUs) has emerged as a major bottleneck in the training process. In this study, we propose Flex-SiPAC, a flexible silicon photonic accelerated compute cluster designed to accelerate multi-tenant distributed DL training workloads. Flex-SiPAC takes a co-design approach that combines a silicon photonic hardware platform with a tailored collective algorithm, optimized to leverage the unique physical properties of the architecture. The hardware platform integrates a novel wavelength-reconfigurable transceiver design and a micro-resonator-based wavelength-reconfigurable switch, enabling the system to achieve flexible bandwidth steering in the wavelength domain. The collective algorithm is designed to support reconfigurable topologies, enabling efficient all-reduce communications that are commonly used in DL training. The feasibility of the Flex-SiPAC architecture is demonstrated through two testbed experiments. First, an optical testbed experiment demonstrates the flexible routing of wavelengths by shuffling an array of input wavelengths using a custom-designed spatial-wavelength selective switch. Second, a four-GPU testbed running two DL workloads shows a 23\% improvement in job completion time compared to a similarly sized leaf-spine topology. We further evaluate Flex-SiPAC using large-scale simulations, which show that Flex-SiPAC is able to reduce the communication time by 26\% to 29\% compared to state-of-the-art compute clusters under representative collective operations.},
