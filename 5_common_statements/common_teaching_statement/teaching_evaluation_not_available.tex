    Due to recent changes in UCSB's TA evaluation reporting system, data from terms prior to Fall 2023 is no longer accessible through the updated system. As a result, I am unable to provide evaluations or feedback on my TA experience from before this period at the time of submitting this application. However, if these records become available in the near future, I would be happy to supplement my application with the relevant information.
