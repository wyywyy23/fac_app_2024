    This paper presents a scalable silicon photonics-based chip I/O architecture designed to address connectivity challenges in hyper-scale computing systems driven by AI and machine learning workloads. By leveraging Kerr comb-driven dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), the proposed system achieves exceptional bandwidth density (over 4\,Tbps/mm and 17\,Tbps/mm$^2$) while maintaining ultra-low energy consumption (sub-pJ/b). Utilizing innovations such as optical frequency comb sources, vertical-junction microresonator modulators, and 3D integration with electronics, the paper demonstrates end-to-end validation of the architecture through experimental results. The findings highlight the potential for energy-efficient, petascale communication to overcome interconnect bottlenecks in future data-centric and high-performance computing infrastructures.
