    This paper details a novel silicon photonics-based transceiver architecture aimed at providing ultra-high-bandwidth and energy-efficient die-to-die connectivity for data centers and high-performance computing systems. By leveraging a multi-free spectral range (multi-FSR) regime and Kerr comb-based dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM), the design achieves over 2\,Tbps/mm bandwidth density at sub-pJ/bit energy consumption. Key innovations include compact even-odd (de-)interleavers, advanced microresonator-based modulators and filters, and wafer-scale substrate undercut techniques to enhance energy efficiency. The work offers a promising pathway to overcoming bandwidth and energy limitations in next-generation computing platforms, addressing the increasing demands of AI and ML workloads.
