            "My research addresses the communication bottleneck in modern computing systems. The grand challenge arises from the exponential growth of data-intensive applications, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. As this figure shows, the size of AI models has been growing nearly an order of magnitude per year, and is far beyond what any single computing node can host. This means that massive data must be communicated between numerous computing nodes, efficiently. What's equally astonishing is the energy associated with these computations. And just to put it in some perspective, the estimated energy used for training the GPT-4 model can power the entire New York City in a hot summer day for more than one hour. And a growing portion of this energy is spent on data movement.",
            "This is because existing interconnect technologies, whether electrical or optical, are limited in bandwidth density and energy efficiency, especially over longer distances. So, my research approaches this challenge from two angles. First, I use integrated silicon photonics to equip computing chips with high-bandwidth and energy-efficient data communication capabilities. Second, I explore the use of silicon photonics to perform computing tasks while data is in motion.",
            "The first piece of work that I will go over today aims to bring photonic connectivity all the way into the computing socket. In this way, we can eliminate the long electrical wires, because data gets converted into the optical domain right at where it is generated. To fit everything into such a small form factor, this work leverages two key factors: 1) comb-driven DWDM, which stands for dense wavelength-division multiplexing, and 2) tight 3D integration of photonics and electronics.",
            "Wavelength-division multiplexing is perhaps one of the most well-known advantages of sending signals with light, because we can put these signals on different wavelengths and let them propagate in the same waveguide or fiber. And then, we can use a structure called a microresonator to modulate or filter each of these wavelengths without affecting others. One of the unique features of this work is that, it is designed to work with a Kerr frequency comb source. This is a device that can generate tens of wavelength channels from a single laser source. We then designed a scalable link architecture that can increase the number of parallel channels per link to 64 and beyond. This is four times higher than the best-in-class commercial solutions. What it really enables is that each channel can now operate at a much lower data rate, which consumes significantly less power.",
            "Besides the link design, another big part of this work is the integration and packaging. Here, I led the design of this photonic integrated circuits, or PIC. It integrates over 2000 microresonator devices within this 8 by 8 mm chip. The photonic devices are driven by an electronic integrated circuit, or EIC, designed at Cornell University. As shown here, the PIC and EIC are flip-chip bonded. And then, three pairs of PIC and EIC are further co-packaged with a compute chip. This packaging is done at Intel through close collaboration among the three teams. It promises a 96\\,Tbps bidirectional bandwidth with a 4\\,Tbps/mm bandwidth density. And all these come with an energy consumption of less than 1\\,pJ/b, thanks to the massive wavelength parallelism of the link architecture.",
            "Here is a comparison of this work to the state-of-the-art. The y-axis is the link figure of merit, plotted against the number of parallel channels per Tera bit of bandwidth. The more right on the x-axis, the \\emph{more} parallel channels operating at a \\emph{lower} speed. It shows that the link FOM significantly benefits from the use of a moderate data rate per channel. Overall, this work represents a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in link FOM over the state-of-the-art. An immediate future extension of this work is to further push the link FOM through heterogeneous integration. For example, my preliminary link budget analysis shows that another order of magnitude improvement is possible if the comb source can be integrated onto the silicon photonics chip to reduce loss.",
            "There are also exciting implications for future computing systems. Since our modulators are optimized for ultra-low driving voltages down to 0.2\\,V, it becomes possible to directly drive the photonic components with the computing or memory chip. This avoids any overhead from the serializers, deserializers, or even the driver circuitry altogether.",
            "With the high bandwidth available at all distances, it also opens up possibilities for new computation models where data locality is no longer a contraints. We can look into network-application co-design to accelerate large-scale computation tasks. Imagine the energy saving if the computation can be done in a fraction of the time it takes today. And this is in addition to the energy saving from the data movement itself."

            "My research is largely motivated by the observation that data movement has become an integral part of computation in today's large-scale computing systems, and I aim to equip the system connectivity with both \\emph{efficient} and \\emph{functional} data movement, which I will go into a bit more details in my later slides, and ultimately unleash the potential for new computing paradigms.",
            "The recent growth of data-intensive applications, such as AI/machine learning, is tremendous, and it requires massive amount of data to be communicated between distributed computing nodes. What's equally significant is the energy associated with the computation. To put it in some perspective, the estimated energy used for training the GPT-4 model can power the entire New York City in a hot summer day for more than one hour. And a growing portion of this energy is spent on data movement, because electrical interconnects face challenges in terms of bandwidth and energy efficiency, especially over long distances. If we look at a figure of merit which is the link bandwidth density times energy efficiency, we can see that electrical interconnects are super good at short distances, but as they go further, the figure of merit drops rapidly. Existing optical solutions, which are essentially the pluggable optical transceivers, do not escape from this trend either, because they were simply not designed for density or energy efficiency.",
            "So, a large part of my research focuses on using integrated silicon photonics to address this challenge by providing distance-agnostic, high-bandwidth connectivity between computing nodes. Beyond addessing the efficiency of data movement, my work also extends to integrating processing and computing functionalities directly within data movement\\textemdash{}essentially enabling computation while data is in motion.",
            "The approach that I take, is to mainly leverage two key factors: 1) wavelength parallelism\\textemdash{}while this is the inherent benefit of communicating with light, here we are targeting 64, or even up to 128 channels per link, uniquely leverging a Kerr comb source, so each channel can really benefit from a moderate data rate that is achievable with low-power electronic drivers, and 2) tight 3D integration of photonics and electronics\\textemdash{}this is to really minimize the extra wiring between the compute unit and the E/O conversion interface which, in today's optical solutions, is usually far away. One of the most significant results along this line was delivered as part of the DARPA PIPES program where I led the development of a photonic I/O chiplet that can be 3D integrated with an electronic driver chiplet and co-packaged with a compute chip, and features 96\\,Tbps bidireciontal bandwidth per package with a 4\\,Tbps/mm shoreline bandwidth density and consumes less than 1\\,pJ/b. This represents a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in link figure of merit over the state-of-the-art.",
            "So, a natural future extension along this line is to leverage two of our key findings / achievements: 1) we can potentially have hundreds of parallel optical channels operating at a moderate data rate like 16\\,Gbps. and 2) our modulators are optimized for ultra-low driving voltages down to about 0.2\\,V. This opens up the possibility of having the optical components directly driven by the I/O pins of the compute or memory chip, completely eliminating the need for serializers/deserializers by matching the electronic and photonic data rates.",
            "In the second line of my research, I focused on leveraging the massive wavelength parallelism to enable computing functionalities within the optical domain, while data is in motion. One example here is an architecture that we will present at OFC this year, which is similar to the wavelength-parallel link architecture but tailored to accelerating multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which are fundamental to AI and machine learning workloads. Many of the traditional approaches to photonic computing often encode data into analog optical properties, such as phase or intensity, which is limited in bit precision and prone to fabrication and environmental variations. Instead, in our approach, we assign each bit place of the MAC result a unique wavelength, and each resonant modulator only operates in a binary fashion, either on or off, making this architecture more robust and scalable. The task of improving bit precision is delegated to increasing the number of parallel wavelength channels, which is where our comb-driven DWDM architecture becomes attractive.",
            "Moving foward along this direction, I imagine that we can potentially have an optically connected memory architecture where photonic accelerators are directly integrated into the optical I/O and interfaced with the memory controller. It also opens up the possibility of new system models designed around the idea that instead of fetching data from the memory, we are fetching the computation results and in a more efficient way than today's solutions. Moreover, we can think of applying the photonic backend to other applications, such as large antenna arrays where electrical signal processing are near its limits, and perhaps an optical communication backend with built-in computing functionalities can enhance its scalability and efficiency.",
            "I also look forward to exploring new directions that can be made possible by further leveraging heterogeneous integration. By exploring new materials and advanced packaging, we can aim to further push the limits of circuit/system performance, as well as enable new functionalities that are otherwise not possible with monolithic integration. For example, glass substrate can be a potential alternative to silicon for photonic integration, with panel size even larger than silicon wafers, great resistance to warpage during packaging, and transparency to light, which makes it attractive for achieving optical routing through the substrate. A particularly exciting future direction is thus to explore a new paradigm of chip-to-chip connectivity that lifts the restrictions of today's planar optical routing. Here, I envision a dense 3D optical system architecture, which enables any-to-any interconnections from waveguide arrays on an active chip to those on another active chip through an interposer-like routing chip, where data stays in the optical domain throughout. This would open up many collaboration opportunities across the system stack, including device, packaging, integration, compute architecture, and design automation, in order to build around this new paradigm an optimized system for future computing.",
            "Another direction that I think are becoming increasingly important to integrated photonic systems as they become larger and more complex is to develop digital twins of the photonic systems. As my PhD background in electronic-photonic design automation had told me, you cannot detach system design from physical models of devices and circuits. This is particularly critical for heterogeneous integration, where diverse material platforms and fabrication processes introduce complexities that can benefit from holistic modeling. By incorporating digital twins into the design flow, we can potentially enable more efficient and accurate design space exploration and reduced design cycles.",
            "In summary, I aim to design integrated photonic systems where optical interconnects are not just high-bandwidth communication channels but also platforms for distributed computing, and I look forward to collaborating with the faculty here to develop an ecosystem around this vision."

This work directly addresses the imminent problem of communication bottlenecks in modern computing systems, where the ever-increasing demands of AI and data-intensive applications have outpaced the capabilities of traditional electrical interconnects. Without addressing this bottleneck, the scalability of future computing systems is fundamentally limited.",
